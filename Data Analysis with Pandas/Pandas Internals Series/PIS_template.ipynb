For example, while NumPy arrays utilize an integer index, Series objects can utilize other index types, like a string index. Series objects also allow for mixed data types and utilize the NaN Python value for handling missing values.\n",

    "A Series object can hold many data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- float - for representing float values\n",
    "- int - for representing integer values\n",
    "- bool - for representing Boolean values\n",
    "- datetime64[ns] - for representing date & time, without time-zone\n",
    "- datetime64[ns, tz] - for representing date & time, with time-zone\n",
    "- timedelta[ns] - for representing differences in dates & times (seconds, minutes, etc.)\n",
    "- category - for representing categorical values\n",
    "- object - for representing String values\n",

    "We learned how to sort a Series object by the index using the reindex() method in this mission. Sorting by reindexing can be cumbersome if we want to order by the rating (the values in the Series) instead of by film name or for quick exploratory data analysis. To make sorting easier, Pandas comes with a <a href = \"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.Series.sort_index.html\">sort_index() method</a>, which returns a Series sorted by the index, and a <a href = \"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.Series.sort_values.html\">sort_values() method</a> method, which returns a Series sorted by the values. Since the values representing the Rotten Tomatoes scores are integers, sorting by values will sort in numerically ascending order (low to high) in our case.\n",

    "In both cases, the link between each element's index (film name) and value (score) is preserved. This is known as data alignment and is a key tenet of Pandas that is incredibly important when analyzing data. Unless we specifically change a value or an index, Pandas allows us to assume the linking will be preserved."

Using a for loop to iterate over the values in a Series object to run itemwise computations is much slower, especially for larger datasets.\n",
