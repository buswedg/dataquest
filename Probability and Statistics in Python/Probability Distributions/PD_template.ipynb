    "To construct our distribution, we had to write our own custom function, and a decent amount of code. We can instead use the <a href = \"http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.binom.html\">binom</a> function from <a href = \"http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html\">SciPy</a> to do this faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a usage example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from scipy import linspace\n",
    "    from scipy.stats import binom\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a range of numbers from 0 to 30, with 31 elements (each number has one entry).\n",
    "    outcome_counts = linspace(0,30,31)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create the binomial probabilities, one for each entry in outcome_counts.\n",
    "    dist = binom.pmf(outcome_counts,30,0.39)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pmf function in SciPy is an implementation of the mathematical <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function\">probability mass function</a>. pmf will give us the probability of each k in our outcome_counts list occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, a binomial distribution only needs two parameters. A parameter is statistical term for a number that summarizes data for the entire population -- in this case, the parameters are N, the total number of events, and p, the probability of the outcome we're interested in seeing. Since we only need two parameters to describe our distribution, these are the numbers we pass into the pmf function from SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the fact that we only need two parameters to describe a distribution, it doesn't matter whether we want to know if it will be sunny 5 days out of 5, or if 5 out of 5 coin flips will turn up heads. As long as the outcome that we care about has the same probability ($p$), and $N$ is the same, the binomial distribution will look the same."

    "We can calculate z-scores (the number of standard deviations away from the mean a probability is) fairly easily. These z-scores can then be used how we used z-scores earlier -- to find the percentage of values to the left and right of the value we're looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this more concrete, say we had 16 days where we observed more than 5000 riders. Is this likely? Unlikely? Using a z-score, we can figure out exactly how common this event is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because every normal distribution, as we learned in an earlier mission, has the same properties when it comes to what percentage of the data is within a certain number of standard deviations of the mean. You can look these up in a <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_normal_table\">standard normal table</a>. About 68% of the data is within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% is within 2, and 99% is within 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the mean (μ ) and standard deviation (σ ) of a binomial probability distribution using the formulas from earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu = N * p$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma = \\sqrt{N*p*q}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to figure out the number of standard deviations from the mean a value is, we just do:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{k - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to find how many standard deviations from the mean 16 days is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{16 - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{16 - (30 * .39)}{\\sqrt{16*.39*.61}} = \\frac{4.3}{1.95} = 2.2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the standard z-score table, this is unlikely -- a 2.8% chance. This tells us that 97.2% of the data is within 2.2 standard deviations of the mean, so so a result to be as different from the mean as this, there is a 2.8% probability that it occurred by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this means both \"sides\" of the distribution. There's a 1.4% chance that a value is 2.2 standard deviations or more above the mean (to the right of the mean), and there's a 1.4% chance that a value is 2.2 standard devitation below the mean (to the left)."

A much faster way is to use the cumulative distribution fuction (cdf) like we did earlier. This won't give us the exact same values as using z-scores, because the distribution isn't exactly normal, but it will give us the actual amount of probability in a distribution to the left of a given k.\n",
