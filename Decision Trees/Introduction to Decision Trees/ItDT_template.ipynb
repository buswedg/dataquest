One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't. In our bear wrestling example, a decision tree can pick up on the fact that you should only run away from large bears when escape is impossible, whereas a linear regression would have had to weight both factors in the absence of the other.\n",

A key concept in this is the notion of a bit of information. One bit of information is one <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_information\">unit of information</a>. It can be represented as a binary number -- a bit of information either has the value 1, or 0. If there's an equal probability of tomorrow being sunny (1) and tomorrow being not sunny (0), if I tell you that it will be be sunny, I've given you one bit of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy can also be thought of in terms of information. If we flip a coin where both sides are heads, we know upfront that the result will be heads. Thus, we gain no new information by flipping the coin, so entropy is 0. On the other hand, if the coin has a heads side and a tails side, there's a 50% probability of landing on either. Thus, flipping the coin gives us one bit of information -- which side the coin landed on. There's much more complexity, especially when you get to cases with more than two possible outcomes, or differential probabilities. However, a deep understanding of entropy isn't necessary for constructing decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for entropy is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$-\\sum_{i=1}^{c} {\\mathrm{P}(x_i) \\log_b \\mathrm{P}(x_i)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through each unique value in a single column (in this case, high_income), and assign it to i . We then compute the probability of that value occurring in the data (P(x i ) ). We then do some multiplication, and all of the values together. b  is the base of the logarithm. 2 is a commonly used value for this, but it can also be set to 10 or another value.\n",

    "We get less than one \"bit\" of information -- we only get .97. This is because there are slightly more 1s in the sample data than 0s. This means that if we were predicting a new value, we could guess that the answer is 1, and be right more often than we're wrong (there's a .6 probability of the answer being 1). Because of this prior knowledge, we gain less than a full \"bit\" of information when we observe a new value."

    "We'll need a way to go from computing entropy to figuring out which variable to split based on. We can do this using information gain. Information gain tells us which split will reduce entropy the most.\n",

    "\n",
    "This may look complicated, but we'll break it down. We're computing information gain (IG ) for a given target variable (T ), and a given variable that we want to split based on (A ). To compute this, we first calculate the entropy for T . Then, for each unique value v  in the variable A , we compute the number of rows in which A  takes on the value v , and divide it by the total number of rows. We then multiply this by the entropy of the rows where A  is v . We add together all of these subset entropies, and subtract from the overall entropy to get information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an even simpler explanation, we're finding the entropy of each set post-split, weighting it by the number of items in each split, then subtracting from the current entropy. If it's positive, we've lowered entropy with our split. The higher it is, the more we've lowered entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy to construct trees to is to create as many branches at each node as there are unique values for the variable being split on. So if the variable has 3 or 4 values, that would result in 3 or 4 branches. Usually, this is more complexity than it's worth, and doesn't improve prediction accuracy, but it's worth knowing about.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the calculation of information gain, and to make splits simpler, we won't do it for each unique value. Instead, for the variable we're splitting on, we'll find the median. Any rows where the value of the variable is below the median will split left, and the rest of the rows will split right. To compute information gain, we'll only have to compute entropies for two subsets.\n",
