Overfitting is the first example, where you memorize the details of the training set, but are unable to generalize to new examples that you're asked to make predictions on.\n",

If we don't perform the artificial restrictions, the tree becomes too complex, and fits quirks in the data that only exist in the training set, but don't generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff\">bias-variance tradeoff</a>. If we take a random sample of training data and create many models, if the predictions of the models for the same row are far apart from each other, we have high variance. If we take a random sample of training data, and create many models, and the predictions of the models for the same row are close together, but far from the actual value, then we have high bias.\n",

    "High bias can cause underfitting -- if a model is consistently failing to predict the correct value, it may be that it is too simple to actually model the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "High variance can cause overfitting -- if a model is very susceptible to small changes in the input data, and changes its predictions massively, then it is likely fitting itself to quirks in the training data, and not making a generalizable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called the bias-variance tradeoff because decreasing one will usually increase the other. This is a limitation of all machine learning algorithms. If you want to read more about the tradeoff, you can look <a href = \"http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html\">here</a>.\n",

    "In general, decision trees suffer from high variance. The whole structure of a decision tree can change if you make a minor alteration to its training data. By restricting the depth of the tree, we increase the bias and decrease the variance. If we restrict the depth too much, we increase bias to the point where it will underfit.\n",
