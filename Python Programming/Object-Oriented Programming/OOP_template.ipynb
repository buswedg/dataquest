Inheriting from a class means that the behavior of the parent also exists in the child, but that the child can still define its own additional behavior.\n",

This is very useful, and there are a lot of things players have in common, but we may want specific behavior for different positions. We can define classes like Center, Forward, or Point Guard, each with behavior that is specific to that position. These classes would each specify Player as its parent class. They would all be siblings, and would each inherit the same behaviors from the Player class, while also containing special behaviors of their own.\n",

When we define classes for the remainder of this mission, we will explicitly specify when a class has object as its parent. This is a good programming practice because if we get in the habit of specifying a class's ancestry, we won't forget to specify a parent when the parent class is something other than object.

The best way to understand is through example.\n",

The sum() function is defined using the addition method, but the object class doesn't really know how to add integers or floating points specifically. However, the integer and float classes define their own addition method (thus overloading the object's addition method), and the sum() function will add the values together properly.
