    "Until now all the variables we have worked with have been continuous. Categorical variables are another type of variable which take on values that are names or labels. The color of a ball (e.g., red, green, blue) or the breed of a dog (e.g., collie, shepherd, terrier) are examples of categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we want to predict the size of the ball using the color of the ball. We know the true diameter of each ball; all green balls are 3 inches in diameter, all red balls are 5 inches in diameter, and all blue balls are 10 inches in diameter. Using the same method as with continuous variables, a linear model may look something like $size = \\beta_{color} * color + intercept$. Right away we see a problem, how do we input color to this model? We cannot simply say that red=1, green=2, and blue=3. This would mean that no matter what our data says a green ball is twice the diameter of a red ball. Instead we can write the equation differently, $diameter = \\beta_{red} * red + \\beta_{green} * green + intercept$ where red and green are binary variables and each $\\beta$ is a coefficient. For each color ball we have the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Red ball -- red=1, green=0, and blue=0. $diameter=\\beta_{red} + intercept$\n",
    "- Green ball -- red=0, green=1, and blue=0. $diameter=\\beta_{green} + intercept$\n",
    "- Blue ball -- red=0, green=0, and blue=1. $diameter=intercept$\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that our model does not explicity contain a blue variable. A blue variable is not needed since we know that if the ball is not red or green then it must be blue. By incorporating the intercept term the model picks this up implicitly. Here we don't make any assumption on which color is greater than the other, but instead we add a coefficient for each. The size of a green ball can be thought of as how much larger or smaller it is than a blue ball, and similar for a red ball. When modeling with these variables we would replace the variable color with two variables, red and green. These are called dummy variables and are used often in practice."

    "In our case, categorical variables exist in three columns, cylinders, year, and origin. Columns cylinders and year must be modified accordingly to predict label origin. These columns take specific values or labels, similar to the ball example above, which cannot be directly used within the model. Though the column year is a number, each year could have vastly different manufacturing numbers. Since we don't have this information it is always safer to treat discrete value as categorical variables. We must use dummy variables for these. For more than two categories we create more columns to represent the categories. For example, there are 5 different categories of cylinders, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. This single categorical column can also be represented by 4 binary columns.\n",

This means that if we simply predicted North America each and every time our accuracy would be 62.5%. Instead it would be great to compute measures like precision and recall to understand the efficiency of this model. To do this, we must start by creating a confusion matrix which aggregates our predictions into a matrix. Each column and row in the matrix will represent observations and predictions for the 3 origins. The values within the matrix will represent the number times an origin was predicted and another was observed.

    "Precision measures the number of correctly predicting origins relative to the total number of positive predictions. For our dataset this measure will give us an idea of how many origins were predicted correctly while accounting for falsely predicted cars in that origin. The equation states, $\\text{precision} = \\dfrac{1}{l}\\sum_{i=1}^l \\frac{tp_i}{tp_i+fp_i}$ where $l$ is the number of classes, $tp_i$ is the true positive count for class $i$ and $tn_i$ is the false positive count for class $i$. This is taking the average of precisions over each class. The precision is in range 0 to 1 where 1 is the best. A precision of 1 states that there were no falsely predicted observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall measures the ability to predict the correct class relative to the total number of observations within that class. If many observations for that class are predicted as false then the classifier is not effective at predicting that class. In our example, if half of the cars in origin 1 are predicted to be in origins 2 and 3 then the classifier would not be considered very effective. The equation generalizes this over each class by averaging, $\\text{recall} = \\dfrac{1}{l}\\sum_{i=1}^l \\frac{tp_i}{tp_i+fn_i}$ where $fn_i$ is the number of false negative predictions of origin i. As with precision, a higher recall indicates a better performing classifier."

For the multiclass case, an F score is computed per class then averaged over each, $F = \\dfrac{1}{l} \\sum_{i=1}^l F_i$. This measure is used to find a balance between precision and recall while allowing for comparision against other models. The F-score falls in the range 0 to 1 with 1 being 'perfect'."

    "Since we now understand how to compute precision, recall, and F-scores, we can use builtin sklearn functions to compute them. sklearn.metrics has many scoring metrics for all different kinds of classifiers. Here we can use precision_score, recall_score, and f1_score. Each of these metrics need two inputs, the true class and the predicted class. There are many other options which we recommend you to read through at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html. Most importantly we must pay attention to the option average. average is a parameter which tells the function how to compute the score. The options are binary -- Only report results for the class specified by pos_label. This is applicable only if targets (y_{true,pred}) are binary. micro -- Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives, false negatives and false positives. macro -- Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account. weighted -- Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label). This alters ‘macro’ to account for label imbalance; it can result in an F-score that is not between precision and recall. * samples -- Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from accuracy_score)."

    "Here we have introduced multiclass classification using the one-versus-all technique with logistic regression. Another popular technique is one-versus-one which requires a model for each possible pair of categories. This technique uses a voting scheme where the class with the largest number of votes is predicted. In our example with 3 classes we would train 3 models, Origin 1 versus Origin 2, Origin 2 versus Origin 3 and Origin 1 versus Origin 3. At test time, an observation would be classifed by choosing the origin with the most \"votes\". The one-versus-one technique is less frequently used because the number of models grows quadratically with the number of classes. A classifier with 10 classes takes a total of 45 models!"
