    "We have a dataset in csv format. It contains information about the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is a US stock market index -- its price is computed by taking into account the prices of all the constituent stocks in the index and weighting them. The S&P 500 has 500 constituent stocks from a variety of sectors, and encompasses a broad swath of the US economy. If you want more information on the process, you can look <a href = \"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/sp500calculation.asp\">here</a>.\n",

    "The idea behind the S&P 500 is that it's an index which indicates how the market as a whole is doing. If Apple stock goes up or down tomorrow, it doesn't tell you much about what's going on with the market as a whole. But if the S&P 500, whose price is computed by evaluating the prices of 500 different stocks, goes down, then the market as a whole probably isn't doing very well. This is why you often hear about indices like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones on the news.\n",
