    "While CSV files are easy to interface with, they have a lot of limitations. As the data gets larger, it becomes more difficult to load the file into a computer's memory, which is how tools like Pandas work with data. CSV files also fall short at providing strict security for production applications (imagine if companies like Google or Facebook used CSV files to store and access data) and are optimized for static representation. If your data changes quickly, which is true for most technology companies, then you'll need to adopt a different method.\n",

Database systems also come with database management software with administrative controls, security and access controls, and a language to interface with the database.\n",
