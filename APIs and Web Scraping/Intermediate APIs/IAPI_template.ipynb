    "◦Typically, you will be accessing an API from a script. If you put your username and password in the script, and someone manages to get their hands on it, they can take over your account. With an access token, you can revoke it if there is a security breach and someone gets access to it. This will cancel their access.\n",
    "◦Access tokens can have scopes and specific permissions. For instance, you can make a token that has permission to write to your Github repositories and make new ones, or you can make a token that can only read from your repositories. This enables you to enforce token security better, and use tokens that only have read access in potentially insecure or shared scripts.\n",

    "After generating a token, you need to pass an Authorization header to the Github API. Just like the server sends us headers in response to our request, we can send the server headers when we make a request. Headers contain metadata about the request. With the requests library, we just make a dictionary of headers, and then pass it into the request when we make it.\n",

    "The Authorization header needs to have the word token, followed by our access token. Here's an example Authorization header:\n",

This isn't a great user experience, so it's typical for API providers to implement pagination. This means that the API provider will only return a certain number of records per page.
