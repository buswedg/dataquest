    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, let's make a few assumptions about the 2-D arrays we are using. First and foremost, let's assume they are static. In other words, their size does not change. Another simplifying assumption that follows is that insertion into our 2-D arrays simply replaces whatever element was there, and that deletion leaves an \"empty\" slot in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only interesting complexity analysis is accessing elements of a 2-D array. Since deletion and insertion replace elements, their complexities will be the same as array access because we must always first find the element we are dealing with.\n",

    "Accessing by index is constant time because we're really dealing with an array of arrays. Accessing the row is constant time, since the row is just an element in a regular array. Then accessing the element within that row is constant time again. Nothing depends on the size of the array, so it is simply constant time.\n",

    "Now let's consider searching for an element (accessing by value). Let's call the height of our array m, and the width n. Behind the scenes, we are really working with an array of size m, where each element in the array is an array of size n. This is simply the array-of-arrays implementation we discussed earlier.\n",

    "\n",
    "This looks a bit different from time complexities we've seen before, but we need to remember what time complexity represents. Our input size is expressed in both height and width, and the time our search takes increases as either m or n grows. Thus, O(m * n) makes sense for the time complexity of a 2-D array traversal."
